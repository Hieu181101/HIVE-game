# HIVE
Implement and building a HIVE boardgame from scratch with interactive UI and be able to play vs AI and friends. 

## Made with

- Java
- Swing (for GUI)

## The Game

- **Tiles and Abilities**: The game consists of different types of insect tiles, each with unique abilities and movement patterns. For example, the Queen Bee can move one space at a time, while other insects like beetles, grasshoppers, ants, and spiders have their own specialized movement abilities.
  
- **Placement and Movement**: The game begins with an empty board, and players take turns placing their tiles. Once placed, tiles can be moved to new positions, but they must always remain connected to the hive. Movement options vary for each insect type, allowing for strategic positioning and encircling the opponent’s pieces.
  
- **Game Objectives**: The primary objective is to surround the opponent’s Queen Bee, but there are alternative ways to win, such as capturing the opponent’s key pieces or forcing their Queen Bee into an immovable position.
  
- **Strategic Depth**: While easy to learn, Hive offers a remarkable depth of strategy. Planning several moves ahead, anticipating the opponent’s actions, and adapting to changing situations are key elements for success.

## Features

- **Game Pause and Resume**: Allows players to pause the game and resume later.
- **In-Game Rule Book**: Provides quick reference to game rules and piece movements.
- **AI Versus AI Mode**: Allows players to watch AI players to learn strategies and tactics.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Helps new players understand the game dynamics effectively.
- **Save and Load Games**: Enables players to save their game state and resume later.
- **Customization**: Allows players to customize the board’s theme and the color and style of their bug pieces.
- **Undo Feature**: Players can retract their moves and reevaluate their strategy.
